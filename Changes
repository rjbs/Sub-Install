0.92    2006-05-11
        allow other users to build exporters like our tiny one (&exporter)
        rename _CALLABLE to _CODELIKE to keep up with Params::Util

0.91    2006-04-30
        use _CALLABLE to determine callability of code, not ref

0.90    2006-04-15
        rewrite warning handling:
          reinstall suppresses fewer warnings: only sub redefinition
          relevant warnings warn from caller (like Carp)
        YOUR CODE MAY BREAK:
          the test/code and documentation differed on install_installers
          the code has been changed to match the documentation
